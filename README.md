ART CENTER is a web-based platform designed to centralize performing artists and event venues on a single digital hub. 
The system helps users discover artists across various traditional and contemporary art forms—such as Bharatanatyam, Chakyarkoothu, Kuchipudi, and many more—while providing an easy and transparent booking experience.
Users can browse artist profiles, explore their work, check availability, and book them directly for events. 
The platform also includes venue listings, allowing users to compare and reserve event spaces based on their requirements. A built-in rating and review system enables users to share feedback, enhancing trust and helping others make informed decisions.

ART CENTER aims to streamline the entire event-planning workflow by making artist and venue discovery more accessible, organized, and efficient through a clean and user-friendly interface.
